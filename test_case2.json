                        "The relationship between electricity and magnetism is fundamental to the field of electromagnetism, describing how electric currents and magnetic fields are interrelated:\nElectromagnetic Induction: When an electric current flows through a conductor, it generates a magnetic field around the conductor, as described by Ampère's law. Conversely, a changing magnetic field through a conductor induces an electric current in the conductor, as formulated by Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This phenomenon is the basis for generating electricity in power plants and the operation of electric generators.\nElectromagnetic Waves: Maxwell's equations unified the theories of electricity and magnetism, predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves propagating through space. These waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation. Examples include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.\nElectromagnetic Forces: Moving electric charges experience a force when placed in a magnetic field, known as the Lorentz force. This force is perpendicular both to the direction of the magnetic field and to the direction of the moving charge. The Lorentz force is fundamental in the operation of electric motors, where the interaction between magnetic fields and current-carrying conductors produces mechanical motion.\nApplications in Technology: The relationship between electricity and magnetism underpins numerous technological applications. Electric motors and generators rely on the conversion between electrical and mechanical energy through electromagnetic principles. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines use powerful magnets to generate detailed images of internal body structures based on the interaction between magnetic fields and hydrogen atoms in the body.\nImpact on Modern Society: The integration of electricity and magnetism has revolutionised modern society, enabling the development of technologies such as telecommunications, power generation and distribution, medical diagnostics, and transportation. Understanding and harnessing these principles continue to drive advancements in science and technology.\nWhat phenomenon describes the generation of an electric current by a changing magnetic field?\n"

                        "Adaptation and mitigation are essential strategies in addressing the challenges posed by climate change, aiming to reduce its impacts on ecosystems, economies, and human well-being while promoting sustainable development.\nAdaptation involves adjusting to the impacts of climate change by building resilience and enhancing the ability of natural and human systems to cope with changes. This may include implementing measures like building climate-resilient infrastructure, diversifying crops to withstand variable weather patterns, restoring degraded ecosystems to enhance their ability to sequester carbon and provide ecosystem services, and implementing early warning systems for extreme weather events.\nOn the other hand, mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the extent of climate change. This involves transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, improving energy efficiency in industries and transportation, promoting afforestation and reforestation efforts to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, and adopting sustainable land use practices that minimise carbon emissions from agriculture and deforestation.\nBoth adaptation and mitigation strategies are crucial components of global efforts to combat climate change. While mitigation aims to address the root causes of climate change by reducing emissions, adaptation seeks to manage the unavoidable impacts that result from already accumulated greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nWhich strategy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change?\n"
